    "title": "Code of Conduct",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Disclaimer\nThis guide borrows heavily (as in copies) large parts from several Code of Conducts listed below. Certain parts have been modified to a large extent in order to make fit-for-purpose, others barely touched.\nList of guides we have copied… (cannot remember all anymore)\n\n\nIntroduction\nWe value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure everyone has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience, both professionally and personally. Accordingly, all members of the Adsorptions group are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times. We create our culture and our culture is inclusive. Please note that this code of conduct supplements, and does not trump, DHRTC and University level policies for your level of employment or study. This document serves as the primary source of information regarding the practicalities of being a member of the Adsorptions lab. The document refers to external documents and websites for more detailed descriptions of specific topics. It is therefore not exhaustive, but should point in the right direction where needed. We try to revise and update the document regularly, and all members are encouraged to provide input, concerns and suggestions.\n\n\nInclusion and diversity\nOur aim is to maintain an inclusive and diverse environment to support each individuals development and research, and to promote robust decision making and high-quality research. All group members must thus dedicate to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and/or religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our group in any form.\nFurthermore, we expect all members to support each other in upholding the following principals: - All communication, be it online or in person, should be appropriate for a professional audience, and be considerate of people from different cultural backgrounds. - Be kind to others, and do not insult or put down other group members. By being supportive we will grow as a team and learn from each other. - Sexual, racist or derogatory/exclusionary language, imagery and jokes are not appropriate at any time. - Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Violation of these rules will lead to a discussion with management. This is regardless of the offenders’ history at DTU, length of contribution, or how specialized their skill set may be. If inappropriate behavior persists, formal processes in line with DTU’s working environment policies will commence.\n\n\nMental health\nThere is increasing evidence that certain attributes of research may challenge your mental health. Specific factors driving this include: - Feelings of isolation in your research; e.g. each researcher focus on their specific topic and it can often feel as if you are working on your own. - Moving to another country, handling a new culture, and loneliness due to absence of friends and family. - Uncertainty in your research and in your career. - So-called “negative results”; i.e. at some point in your research, it is likely that certain questions will be more challenging to answer than anticipated, or that you will feel you have spent days/months/years toiling with little to show. - Burnout; i.e. feeling the need to work endless hours to make up for the above issues, and the subsequent exhaustion.\nAcademics at all levels come across most of these issues at some level. We strongly encourage everyone in the group to take an active and preemptive approach towards the maintenance of their mental health. Some risk factors may be reduced with appropriate measures, whilst others are more difficult to prevent. We encourage everyone to establish collaborations, ensuring a healthy work-life balance and sharing both successes and failures openly. Please remember that it is never wrong or shameful to reach out or ask for help. If there is anything that is placing undue stress or preventing you from performing at your potential, please do not hesitate in letting us know. We take all matters seriously and will support you fully if for example a reduced workload is required for a period of time. Furthermore, Corporate HR provides psychological counseling for all employees. (including Ph.D. students) This can be scheduled either as in-person meetings, by e-mail or telephone and you have the possibility of being anonymous. More information is available on Inside.\n\n\nWorking hours\nOur stance is that you can be a successful and productive researcher without excessive overtime. We believe that it is best to work effectively during a set period of time and restitute during evenings and weekends. However, we recognize that people have different routines, non-work-related and family responsibilities. Thus, the group operates under flexible working hours with freedom under responsibility. This means that you are free to set your own schedule to fit your daily routines. However, all group members are expected to be present at the center between 09 and 15 on weekdays (core hours). This is to facilitate collaboration and discussions with other staff members. Meetings will typically not be scheduled outside of those hours.\nExperimental work during late afternoons (after 19.00) or weekends is generally not allowed. Exceptions can be made when necessary. This is both for safety reasons and a measure to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Please try to plan your experiments to minimize such activities. If you have an important experiment that due to time or other constraints requires weekend attendance, you need approval from me and our lab manager. When working on weekends you must notify us when you enter and when you leave the laboratory.\n\n\nVacation\nAll employees are employed under a concurrent holiday scheme. This means that you earn 2.08 days per month (plus 0.42 special holidays) which you are free to use immediately or save up for a longer consecutive holiday. According to rules and regulations, all staff should have three consecutive weeks of vacation during a full working year. This is usually planned during the summer holidays. We recommend that this is followed, as DTU will be reasonably empty during a period of July and August. Beyond this, everyone are free to plan and schedule their vacation according to own preferences. But please let other group members know when taking time off.\n\n\nCommunication and meetings\nWe have three modes of communication 1) in-person 2) e-mail 3) Slack channel. You are free to choice the one you are most comfortable. E-mails outside working hours (Monday to Friday, 08.00 - 17.00) is discouraged with few exceptions (i.e. close to an important deadline, travelling etc). Members of the group are not expected to read or answer e-mails outside working hours. If writing e-mails at odd hours, it is recommended to schedule them to be sent during working hours using the ‘Delay Delivery’ function in Outlook."

This includes sensor chemistry, functional materials for analytical applications, and separation science. More specifically, we work with the design and application of metal-organic frameworks. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid materials that form via the self-assembly of inorganic nodes with organic linker molecules. This yields highly ordered network solids that extend in up to three dimensions. Metal-organic frameworks are characterized by their high porosity, contact area, and modularity. By understanding structure-property relationships, we can tailor materials for specific applications, for example, sensing by analyte enrichment and background exclusion. We apply a variety of gravimetric and spectroscopic techniques to probe these interactions.\nFurthermore, the group is interested in advanced multi-dimensional chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry to probe complex systems, e.g., environmental and process analytical technology. Here, a fundamental interest is the development of reactors and microfluidic devices that allow in-situ monitoring with a high level of automation."

You are the main driver for success, and your career future depends on it.\n\nThis means taking the responsibility to keep the project organized, making continuous progress, and finished as in running the necessary experiments, drafting manuscripts, reports and thesis (for Ph.D. students) in time."

This is especially important for project and group meetings.\n\nWhen discussing progress and challenges, you are expected to have prepared a presentation with detailed slides on results, data and figures.\n\nPlease remember that I juggle several tasks and projects. Therefore, I cannot remember everything. Although it is my obligation to also come prepared, I might ask questions that for you are clear but not for me.\n\nAlways consider your audience when preparing for meetings. A technical meeting with your supervisors is different than a project progress meeting with management."

The unique identifier must follow all associated items (i.e. ELN, raw data files, result files).\n\nNotebooks must be include documentation to the extent that it allows other researchers with similar training to repeat the experiment.\n\nSmall data files should (in addition to storage on the file server) be attached to the corresponding experiment. Larger files (> 100 mb) should only be stored on the file server (with a location reference included in the ELN entry)\nCarry out regular backup of all written documents, data and similar. This is preferably done on your personal M-drive (NOT on the local drive of your laptop). Research data should be stored on the group network folder. (see the Research Data Management section)"

This typically means at least two weeks in advance.\n\nRemember that proofs with a large number of corrections and comments should not be taken as a critique, but as an indication that I take this job seriously and am here to help you develop."
